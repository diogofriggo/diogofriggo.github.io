          <p>The journey begins!</p>
          <p>MS paint was the pinnacle of software at the time, enough to amaze a geek teenager. Every aspect of a PC

          <h2>First job!</h2>
          <p>
            Opportunities to work with software development for unexperienced developers (however academically qualified) were <b>scarce</b> at the
            time - there wasn't such a shortage of talent as is common nowadays.<br/>
            So I got very excited when I learned that a multinational software and hardware company had recently opened a branch in Brazil. <br/>
            Still, they had a ton of developers already and didn't need one more - much less an inexperienced one. <br/>
            It was my <b>first interview in English</b> and having studied English extensively since I was a child I
            did very well, so when they turned me down for a developer role I told them:</p> <blockquote>Hey, you're still going to need
              someone to handle english-portuguese communication with local clients, I could do that</blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a long shot and not really what I wanted but in my head I planned on switching roles as soon as possible - I just <b>needed to get in</b> somehow.<br/>
            I pushed my luck and it worked! They said they did indeed need someone to translate documents and help with talking to local clients both in-person and via Skype.</p>
          <p>
            Now I just needed to do a good job and convince them that an academic programmer could do commercial work,
            so I found the perfect opportunity to show my qualifications: <b>student to business...</b>
          </p>

          <h2>Student to Business</h2>
          <p>In partnership with <b>Microsoft</b> and a local university, <b>Dell</b> launched a program to qualify aspiring software
            developers in different areas around the .NET ecosystem like</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Systems Development</li>
            <li>Network Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>More than three thousand applicants had to go through a test to qualify for the program.
            From those, 68 remained where we studied among other things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compilers</li>
            <li>Managed vs Unmanaged code</li>
            <li>VS 2018 GUI apps</li>
            <li>Programming Logic and Fundamentals on C#</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            <li>ASP.NET</li>
            <li>Web Development Fundamentals</li>
            <li>UX</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>Web Services, SOAP</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All activities were <b>heavily exercise-oriented</b>. We partenered with a colleague and did several exercises a day<br/>
            The course was organized in stages, and we had to pass exams to advance to each next stage.
          </p>

          <h3>Student to Business Advanced</h3>

          <p>Through yet another exam, further 8 applicants were selected to join S2B Advanced</br>
          Here we delved deeper into earlier topics as well as learning theoretical aspects of XML and communication protocols

          <h2>Software developer at last!</h2>

          <p>
            Succeeding in S2B was my way of proving to my employer that I was able to develop commercial software and
            leave my role as translator.
            So adding it to my 3-year technicial in programming plus a Microsoft Certified Tech Specialist in
            <b>.NET Framework Web Applications</b> and a host of shorter courses on a range of tech subjects I was ready
            to talk to the head of software development and ask for an opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            On that same day I met the branch director over lunch with the dev team's manager. I had a stack of certificates in my backpack.<br/>
            That was the perfect opportunity and I seized it. I told them of my ambition and hard work put into becoming a software
            developer and how much I'd like to be part of the dev team.<br/>
            The director looked at my manager and said:</p> <blockquote>Why is this guy not developing software yet?</blockquote>
          <p>
            That was a happy day!

          <h2>Software developer at HCL</h2>

          <p>
            I had many very competent, motivated and experienced colleagues to learn from.
            What I learned from them was worth every single ounce of hard work to get there. But the person who enabled
            me to grow the most was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alklaser/">Alexandre Klaser</a>. He had a huge
            impact not only on my career but also on my personal life. I admire him to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some would question whether an inexperienced dev was a right fit for the project, Alexandre would
            trust me with more and more responsibilities, to the point that after 1 year the once inexperienced dev
            would then be in charge in defining and mantaining the architecture of new projects and addressing doubts
            from more experienced developers
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many companies at the time we were trying to push for Agile adoption.
            And like many companies we failed on some respects but succeeded in many others.
            One of the most gratifying feedback from a client went like this:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            We've been trying to build this inventory management system for years and everytime on the delivery day
            we'd find out that what we got is not what we wanted. Your are the first company to deliver what we asked for
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            That was not by accident. We delivered biweekly. By the final delivery stakeholders would have had plenty of
            opportunities to say that we were not building what they wanted. That's why we succeeded!
          </p>

          <p>
            We tried to follow Agile by the book (or should I say by the manifesto) but reality, company- and
            client-specific issues presented many unforeseen challenges. I had a wonderful team that acted in good-faith
            and with the client's interest in mind and heart and managed to overcome every obstacle.
            I think it's fair to say that Agile provided the framework and the people, the engine.
          </p>

          <h3>Full-stack developer</h3>
          <p>
              I'd build applications from the ground up with an Agile team. From the HTML, vanilla CSS
              (no SASS, Stylus and the like back then) and JavaScript in the front-end to C#, ASP .NET MVC and
              MS SQL with NHibernate on the back-end<br/>
              On the front-end we experimented with many different libraries and did some projects with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> but it was
              too bare bones and we ended up settling for the more feature-complete <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a><br/>
              Other mature libraries that we have today like React were not in existence back then.<br/>
              On the server side we had great separation of concerns and the architecture served us well on all projects
          </p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Among many commercial projects we developed I'd highlight the following three which we've built from scratch:
            <ul>
              <li>A pharmaceutical management system for a brazilian healthcare company, this project also featured as
                spin-off a web app that would track drug delivery just as is common nowadays when you order food</li>
              <li>An insurance management system for an american firm based in Chicago</li>
              <li>A personnel and operations management system for a large roads operator in Latin America</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Computer Science: the good stuff</h2>
          <p>
            Ever more fascinated with programming I decided to step up my game and got into university.<br/>
            This was my first experience in college. I learned a lot of valuable things that'd later shape career and academic decisions<br/>
            I loved and excelled at many STEM subjects like:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Probability theory</li>
              <li>Linear algebra</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Formal propositional Logic (just apply a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">Modus Ponens</a>!)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>My great interest in calculus led the professor to invite me to mentor students the following semester.</p>
          <p>When I decided to join college I had a really weak background in math and I knew that CS would be math heavy<br/>
          Khan Academy was unknown at the time but there was great content to be found if you knew where to look.
          I found Jason with his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathtutordvd.com/">MathTutorDVD</a> amazing series, I took one
          entire vacation from work + a few more months leading to college and studied them all:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core Math</li>
            <li>Algebra 1</li>
            <li>Algebra 2</li>
            <li>Trig & Pre-Calculus</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These provided me with a strong foundation for college and beyond</p>

          <h2>Computer Science dropout</h2>
          <p>
            I struggled in some classes mostly because I couldn't in any way get interested in them. A geek like me
            finds entertainment in the most arcane wikipedia article so that was a hint that something was not right
          <p>
            There were also a lot of other classes that were not exactly my cup of tea but were worth learning like
            <ul>
              <li>Computer Architecture focused on hardware</li>
              <li>Algorithm Complexity Analysis</li>
              <li>Logic Circuits</li>
              <li>Ethics and Antropology</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            And some others I downright disagreed with the approach to it like <b>Requirements Engineering</b> where
            they preached old proven-to-be-wrong-from-decades-of-failure methods. <br/>
            I was practicing <a target="_blank" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> in a multinational
            software dev company at the time and this class would argue for the opposite. Listening to it was like hearing the sound of fingernails scraping a chalkboard!<br/>
            It's important to understand what these approaches were and why they failed but never to encourage using them when a better alternative is widely known!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of two years I reflected upon the choices I had made so far and the path that they have led me to. <br/>
            Even though I had barely any regrets, after those STEM classes I felt that I needed to learn more about applied mathematics -
            physics in particular - and so I left CS for good<br/>
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since programming continued to be an integral part of my life, I frequently ended up
            studying the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">field</a> since then</p>

          <p>
            After getting to know PUC university from my time in the S2B program, I started to watch some of their
            open lectures on software. <br/> One of them in particular caught my attention. It was a lecture on how <b>NodeJS</b> could be
            used to reverse the HTTP model, that is, actively sending a response to clients without them having
            initiated a request in the first place!<br/>
            Nowadays this is known as the <b>WebSocket protocol</b>, but it was exciting news back then.<br/>
            Inspired by the lecture I built a collaborative keyboard later on that day.<br/>
            The project is still live, <a href="http://node-keyboard.herokuapp.com/">check it out</a><br/>

          <h2>The path to UFRGS</h2>
          <p>
            In this year <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ufrgs.br/">UFRGS</a> would feature as best federal university for the 2nd
            time in a row and would keep the crown for 6 more years!
            That's where I wanted to study some sort of applied mathematics. <br/>
            While researching which course was the best fit to what I wanted to learn I found <b>Physics Engineering</b> - a perfect match!<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Admission on my previous university was very easy. Being admitted in one of the best universities of the country was an entirely different challenge.<br/>
            Even though I had improved a lot on my math skills I knew I still had a <b>very poor background</b> on every other
            subject like History, Chemistry, Biology, Literature... well, basically everything else.
            That was so because the level of teaching in public schools where I grew up is light-years behind what's required to join higher-level studies.<br/>
            So even though I have always been a good student and had excellent grades I knew that coming from a public school I had a lot of catching up to do.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to focus all my attention on it so I <b>quit my job</b>, took the money I had and payed for a full-year
            preparation course to UFRGS's fiercely competetitive admission exams (much like SATs) which cover in-depth every subject learned in school.<br/>
            I used my remaining savings to support myself during the whole year, frequently having to make some hard
            choices on priorites like having enough money for commute and food or buying required books.

          <h2>Physics Engineering!</h2>
          <p>
            After a full year of preparation culminating in four long days of admission exams I fulfilled the <b>dream</b> of getting into this university!<br/>
            Physics engineering was a very new course. When I joined, there wasn't any graduates yet.
            However, the curriculum and the idea behind the course was enough to dispel any doubts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was simple: just as a mechanical engineer applies well-know physics established some 4 centuries
            ago and an electrical engineer applies physics known for over 2 centuries, a physics engineer would be in a
            position to apply <b>20th-century-onwards physics</b> into solving real-life issues, particularly ones involving cutting-edge technology.
            Keep in mind the nearly exponential growth of science output before thinking the physics engineer has less to learn!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since science is built upon earlier work rather than replacing it, for the first two years we learned the
            foundations common to all engineering courses such as:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Foundational Physics</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Technical drawing</li>
              <li>Fundamental Chemistry</li>
              <li>Linear Algebra</li>
              <li>Probality and Statistics</li>
              <li>Classical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Electromagnetic Theory</li>
              <li>Applied Mathematics (think Fourier transforms and Vector analysis)</li>
              <li>Differential Equations Theory</li>
              <li>Thermodynamics</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The physics engineer also learns about a bunch of other subjects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mathematical Methods (think calculus in the complex plane, green's functions) </li>
              <li>Nanotechnology</li>
              <li>Photonics</li>
              <li>Biophysics</li>
              <li>Computational Methods</li>
              <li><b>Quantum Mechanics</b> (perhaps the toughest subject - we joke that this is the course's turning point)</li>
              <li>Analog and digital eletronics</li>
              <li>Instrumentation</li>
              <li>Radiation and Matter Interaction</li>
              <li>Econophysics</li>
              <li>Spectroscopy</li>
              <li>Semiconductors</li>
              <li>Microprocessors</li>
              <li>Statistical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Solid State Theory</li>
              <li>Renewable Energy</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            I can't list everything out here or you'll be bored to death. Let me just say that it's 5 intense years of
            studying and certainly the best decision I've made in my academic career, what I learned at UFRGS is
            priceless, it opened up whole new worlds to me.<br/>
            Additionally to the regular subjects UFRGS allows one to attend classes from different courses.
            I took a class on <b>Particle Physics</b> for physics graduates and one of the hardest classes in
            Mathematics: <b>Analysis</b> (certainly the hardest I've taken, ever)

          <h2>A boring day at university!</h2>

          <p>
            One day at uni when I had some classes in the morning and the next classes only late in the afternoon I
            felt bored as there was no homework to be done nor any other task that needed my attention.
            I remembered that my cousin was addicted to games and would play nonstop. I wished he'd do something more challenging to his intellect.<br/>
            So to help him I opened up a book-tutorial on <b>Unity</b> and built a game with it so I could show to him how the thing he likes is
            done so that perhaps a taste of game development and programming would lure him into the hard sciences (as in all the math behind a game).
            It was surprisingly little effort for such a great result.<br/>
            I basically managed to build a <b>3d third person game</b> where the character can roam accross an island
            discovering the bright-colored landscape full of trees and hills under a shining sun<br/>
            I tweaked gravity and friction so he'd be able to perform some stunts and climb the steepest hills.
            Pardon the landscaping - not my strong suit!<br/>
            Unfortunately he did not find it nearly as interesting as I had hoped. <br/>
            I think he was too young for it back then. Perhaps I'll try it again!
