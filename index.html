          <p>The journey begins!</p>
          <p>MS paint was the pinnacle of software at the time, enough to amaze a geek teenager. Every aspect of a PC

          <h2>First job!</h2>
          <p>
            Opportunities to work with software development for unexperienced developers (regardless of academic qualification) were <b>scarce</b> at the
            time - there wasn't such a shortage of talent as is common nowadays.<br/>
            So I got very excited when I learned that a multinational software and hardware company had recently opened a branch in Brazil. <br/>
            Still, they had a ton of developers already and didn't need one more - much less an inexperienced one. <br/>
            It was my <b>first interview in English</b> and having studied English extensively since I was a child I
            did very well, so when they turned me down for a developer role I told them:</p> <blockquote>Hey, you're still going to need
              someone to handle english-portuguese communication with local clients, I could do that</blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a long shot and not really what I wanted but in my head I planned on switching roles as soon as possible - I just <b>needed to get in</b> somehow.<br/>
            I pushed my luck and it worked! They said they did indeed need someone to translate documents and help with talking to local clients both in-person and via Skype.</p>
          <p>
            Now I just needed to do a good job and convince them that an academic programmer could do commercial work,
            so I found the perfect opportunity to show my qualifications: <b>student to business...</b>
          </p>

          <h2>Student to Business</h2>
          <p>In partnership with <b>Microsoft</b> and a local university, <b>Dell</b> launched a program to qualify aspiring software
            developers in different areas around the .NET ecosystem like</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Systems Development</li>
            <li>Network Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>More than three thousand applicants had to go through a test to qualify for the program.
            From those, 68 remained where we studied among other things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compilers</li>
            <li>Managed vs Unmanaged code</li>
            <li>VS 2018 GUI apps</li>
            <li>Programming Logic and Fundamentals on C#</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            <li>ASP.NET</li>
            <li>Web Development Fundamentals</li>
            <li>UX</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>Web Services, SOAP</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All activities were <b>heavily exercise-oriented</b>. We partenered with a colleague and did several exercises a day<br/>
            The course was organized in stages, and we had to pass exams to advance to each next stage.
          </p>

          <h3>Student to Business Advanced</h3>

          <p>Through yet another exam, further 8 applicants were selected to join S2B Advanced</br>
          Here we delved deeper into earlier topics as well as learning theoretical aspects of XML and communication protocols
          </p>

          <h2>Software developer at last!</h2>

          <p>
            Succeeding in S2B was my way of proving to my employer that I was able to develop commercial software and
            leave my role as translator.
            So adding it to my 3-year technicial in programming plus a Microsoft Certified Tech Specialist in
            <b>.NET Framework Web Applications</b> and a host of shorter courses on a range of tech subjects I was ready
            to talk to the head of software development and ask for an opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            On that same day I met the branch director over lunch with the dev team's manager. I had a stack of certificates in my backpack.<br/>
            That was the perfect opportunity and I seized it. I told them of my ambition and hard work put into becoming a software
            developer and how much I'd like to be part of the dev team.<br/>
            The director looked at my manager and said:</p> <blockquote>Why is this guy not developing software yet?</blockquote>
          <p>
            That was a happy day!

          <div class="date">2010-2013</div>
          <h2>Software developer at HCL</h2>

          <p>
            I had many very competent, motivated and experienced colleagues to learn from.
            What I learned from them was worth every single ounce of hard work to get there. But the person who enabled
            me to grow the most was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alklaser/">Alexandre Klaser</a>. He had a huge
            impact not only on my career but also on my personal life. I admire him to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some would question whether an inexperienced dev was a right fit for the project, Alexandre would
            trust me with more and more responsibilities, to the point that after 1 year the once inexperienced dev
            would then be in charge in defining and mantaining the architecture of new projects and addressing doubts
            from more experienced developers
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many companies at the time we were trying to push for Agile adoption.
            And like many companies we failed on some respects but succeeded in many others.
            One of the most gratifying feedback from a client went like this:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            We've been trying to build this inventory management system for years and everytime on the delivery day
            we'd find out that what we got is not what we wanted. Your are the first company to deliver what we asked for
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            That was not by accident. We delivered biweekly. By the final delivery stakeholders would have had plenty of
            opportunities to say that we were not building what they wanted. That's why we succeeded!
          </p>

          <p>
            We tried to follow Agile by the book (or should I say by the manifesto) but reality, company- and
            client-specific issues presented many unforeseen challenges. I had a wonderful team that acted in good-faith
            and with the client's interest in mind and heart and managed to overcome every obstacle.
            I think it's fair to say that Agile provided the framework and the people, the engine.
          </p>

          <h3>Full-stack developer</h3>
          <p>
              I'd build applications from the ground up with an Agile team. From the HTML, vanilla CSS
              (no SASS, Stylus and the like back then) and JavaScript in the front-end to C#, ASP .NET MVC and
              MS SQL with NHibernate on the back-end<br/>
              On the front-end we experimented with many different libraries and did some projects with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> but it was
              too bare bones and we ended up settling for the more feature-complete <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a><br/>
              Other mature libraries that we have today like React were not in existence back then.<br/>
              On the server side we had great separation of concerns and the architecture served us well on all projects
          </p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Among many commercial projects we developed I'd highlight the following three which we've built from scratch:
            <ul>
              <li>A pharmaceutical management system for a brazilian healthcare company, this project also featured as
                spin-off a web app that would track drug delivery just as is common nowadays when you order food</li>
              <li>An insurance management system for an american firm based in Chicago</li>
              <li>A personnel and operations management system for a large roads operator in Latin America</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Computer Science: the good stuff</h2>
          <p>
            Ever more fascinated with programming I decided to step up my game and got into university.<br/>
            This was my first experience in college. I learned a lot of valuable things that'd later shape career and academic decisions<br/>
            I loved and excelled at many STEM subjects like:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Probability theory</li>
              <li>Linear algebra</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Formal propositional Logic (just apply a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">Modus Ponens</a>!)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>My great interest in calculus led the professor to invite me to mentor students the following semester.</p>
          <p>When I decided to join college I had a really weak background in math and I knew that CS would be math heavy<br/>
          Khan Academy was unknown at the time but there was great content to be found if you knew where to look.
          I found Jason with his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathtutordvd.com/">MathTutorDVD</a> amazing series, I took one
          entire vacation from work + a few more months leading to college and studied them all:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core Math</li>
            <li>Algebra 1</li>
            <li>Algebra 2</li>
            <li>Trig & Pre-Calculus</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These provided me with a strong foundation for college and beyond</p>

          <h2>Computer Science dropout</h2>
          <p>
            I struggled in some classes mostly because I couldn't in any way get interested in them. A geek like me
            finds entertainment in the most arcane wikipedia article so that was a hint that something was not right
          <p>
            There were also a lot of other classes that were not exactly my cup of tea but were worth learning like
            <ul>
              <li>Computer Architecture focused on hardware</li>
              <li>Algorithm Complexity Analysis</li>
              <li>Logic Circuits</li>
              <li>Ethics and Antropology</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            And some others I downright disagreed with the approach to it like <b>Requirements Engineering</b> where
            they preached old proven-to-be-wrong-from-decades-of-failure methods. <br/>
            I was practicing <a target="_blank" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> in a multinational
            software dev company at the time and this class would argue for the opposite. Listening to it was like hearing the sound of fingernails scraping a chalkboard!<br/>
            It's important to understand what these approaches were and why they failed but never to encourage using them when a better alternative is widely known!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of two years I reflected upon the choices I had made so far and the path that they have led me to. <br/>
            Even though I had barely any regrets, after those STEM classes I felt that I needed to learn more about applied mathematics -
            physics in particular - and so I left CS for good<br/>
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since programming continued to be an integral part of my life, I frequently ended up
            studying the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">field</a> since then</p>

          <p>
            After getting to know PUC university from my time in the S2B program, I started to watch some of their
            open lectures on software. <br/> One of them in particular caught my attention. It was a lecture on how <b>NodeJS</b> could be
            used to reverse the HTTP model, that is, actively sending a response to clients without them having
            initiated a request in the first place!<br/>
            Nowadays this is known as the <b>WebSocket protocol</b>, but it was exciting news back then.<br/>
            Inspired by the lecture I built a collaborative keyboard later on that day.<br/>
            The project is still live, <a href="http://node-keyboard.herokuapp.com/">check it out</a><br/>

            While researching which course was the best fit to what I wanted to learn I found <b>Physics Engineering</b> - a perfect match!<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Admission on my previous university was very easy. Being admitted in one of the best universities of the country was an entirely different challenge.<br/>
            Even though I had improved a lot on my math skills I knew I still had a <b>very poor background</b> on every other
            subject like History, Chemistry, Biology, Literature... well, basically everything else.
            That was so because the level of teaching in public schools where I grew up is light-years behind what's required to join higher-level studies.<br/>
            So even though I have always been a good student and had excellent grades I knew that coming from a public school I had a lot of catching up to do.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to focus all my attention on it so I <b>quit my job</b>, took the money I had and payed for a full-year
            preparation course to UFRGS's fiercely competetitive admission exams (much like SATs) which cover in-depth every subject learned in school.<br/>
            I used my remaining savings to support myself during the whole year, frequently having to make some hard
            choices on priorites like having enough money for commute and food or buying required books.

          <h2>Physics Engineering!</h2>
          <p>
            After a full year of preparation culminating in four long days of admission exams I fulfilled the <b>dream</b> of getting into this university!<br/>
            Physics engineering was a very new course. When I joined, there wasn't any graduates yet.
            However, the curriculum and the idea behind the course was enough to dispel any doubts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was simple: just as a mechanical engineer applies well-know physics established some 4 centuries
            ago and an electrical engineer applies physics known for over 2 centuries, a physics engineer would be in a
            position to apply <b>20th-century-onwards physics</b> into solving real-life issues, particularly ones involving cutting-edge technology.
            Keep in mind the nearly exponential growth of science output before thinking the physics engineer has less to learn!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since science is built upon earlier work rather than replacing it, for the first two years we learned the
            foundations common to all engineering courses such as:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Foundational Physics</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Technical drawing</li>
              <li>Fundamental Chemistry</li>
              <li>Linear Algebra</li>
              <li>Probality and Statistics</li>
              <li>Classical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Electromagnetic Theory</li>
              <li>Applied Mathematics (think Fourier transforms and Vector analysis)</li>
              <li>Differential Equations Theory</li>
              <li>Thermodynamics</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The physics engineer also learns about a bunch of other subjects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mathematical Methods (think calculus in the complex plane, green's functions) </li>
              <li>Nanotechnology</li>
              <li>Photonics</li>
              <li>Biophysics</li>
              <li>Computational Methods</li>
              <li><b>Quantum Mechanics</b> (perhaps the toughest subject - we joke that this is the course's turning point)</li>
              <li>Analog and digital eletronics</li>
              <li>Instrumentation</li>
              <li>Interaction of Radiation and Matter</li>
              <li>Econophysics</li>
              <li>Spectroscopy</li>
              <li>Semiconductors</li>
              <li>Microprocessors</li>
              <li>Statistical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Solid State Theory</li>
              <li>Renewable Energy</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            I can't list everything out here or you'll be bored to death. Let me just say that it's 5 intense years of
            studying where we learn a bit of everything so that as graduates we may choose to specialize in one or more particular areas of engineering.<br/>
            It was one of the best decisions I've made in life - what I learned at UFRGS is priceless, it opened up whole new worlds to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally to the regular subjects, UFRGS also allows one to attend classes from different departments.
            So I took a <b>introductory</b> class on Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Electrodynamics for theoretical physicists and a class from the mathematics
            department: <b>Analysis</b> - by far the hardest subject I've ever taken but immensily beautiful at the same time<br/>
            The following cards will feature a few hightlights of my time at uni

          <p>
            When taking Organic Chemistry I automated the <b>tedious</b> task of extracting an irreducible representation from a reducible one<br/>
            I started it in <b>Ruby</b> and later switched to Python due to better library support.
            The code takes user input, downloads all character tables from <a href="http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de/">http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de/</a>
            and returns the corresponding irreducible representation.<br/>
            I shared this with classmates saving us a lot of time!<br/>

          <h2>Batman potential</h2>
          <p>
            Exact solutions to quantum problems are far and between and only exist for highly idealized or simple
            systems like a square potential. But computational physics knows no bounds!
            I wanted to show to my classmates that we could take the ideas we learned and apply it to any system.
            They were skeptical so instead of simulating a square potential like this:

            <img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/square.png" alt="Square Potential">

            I simulated a batman potential:

            <img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/batman.gif" alt="Batman Potential">

            That's a probability wave interacting with a potential type Batman as I have dubbed it.<br/>
            At each step Schrödinger's equation is being solved for each value of the domain<br/>
          </p>
            <blockquote>Fun fact: note how some probability is sneaking through to the other side of the square potential.</blockquote>
          <p>
            Classical mechanics says this is impossible. It's the macroscopic equivalent of a throwing a <b>ball at a wall</b>
            and expecting that it'll eventually <b>go through</b> unscathed if you try enough times. Not impossible in the quantum world!
          </p>
          <p>
            The animation in the bottom depicts the same process in momentum space.<br/>
            For the math geeks out there: that is a function! It doesn't appear so but it is piecewise defined so it
            is injective (how else could I draw a batman shape with a function?)<br/>
            This also means that it's highly discontinuous, go solve that on pen and paper!<br/>

          <h2>Fast Fourier Transform: Functional Programming</h2>

          <p>The FFT by itself can be used on pictures to reveal some really interesting physics. <br/>
            Take a look at the cover where on the right you have the Fourier-transformed version of the
            left picture, produced by just applying an inverse fourier transform to each pixel on the left<br/>
            The left picture is a microscopy image of <b>graphene</b> while on the right you see it in momentum space revealing several symmetries
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution of the Schrödinger's equation for the Batman potential in the card above requires computing Fourier transforms<br/>
            I ended up doing it in Python but I wanted to try it on a functional language so I picked up some <b>Haskell</b>
            and the resulting code is quite neat (5 lines) since the problem lends itself well to a functional style:

          <h2>A boring day at university!</h2>

          <p>
            One day at uni when I had some classes in the morning and the next classes only late in the afternoon I
            felt bored as there was no homework to be done nor any other task that needed my attention.
            I remembered that my cousin was addicted to games and would play nonstop. I wished he'd do something more challenging to his intellect.<br/>
            So to help him I opened up a book-tutorial on <b>Unity</b> and built a game with it so I could show to him how the thing he likes is
            done so that perhaps a taste of game development and programming would lure him into the hard sciences (as in all the math behind a game).
            It was surprisingly little effort for such a great result.<br/>
            I basically managed to build a <b>3d third person game</b> where the character can roam accross an island
            discovering the bright-colored landscape full of trees and hills under a shining sun<br/>
            I tweaked gravity and friction so he'd be able to perform some stunts and climb the steepest hills.
            Pardon the landscaping - not my strong suit!<br/>
            Unfortunately he did not find it nearly as interesting as I had hoped. <br/>
            I think he was too young for it back then. Perhaps I'll try him again!

          <p>
            This internship was required as part of my Physics Engineering degree. <br/>
            Since I was deeply interested in the work I was doing I wrote my undergraduate thesis on a <b>stochastic</b> model aimed
            at predicting wind speed behaviour (and thus energy production) at short time-scales<br/>
            It was entirely developed in <b>R</b> relying on its excellent statistical libraries.<br/>
            Below you can get an idea of the main result: good prediction 4 months into the future without ad-hoc assumptions about the model<br/>
            Y-axis represents wind speed and X-axis days.

            DNV is a large assurance and classification company that has been building its business on trust for over 1.5 centuries<br/>
            With more than 12000 employees spread across the globe, it is present in many markets. <br/>
            I work on one of its largest divisions: <b>Energy Systems</b>, where I carry out Wind Energy Assessments and develop <b>R&D</b> projects. <br/>
            Nowadays I work with a highly motivated team of <b>~50 engineers</b> spread across Central and South America, Iberia, Africa and Middle East.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an engineer I've worked so far on 60 projects for external clients: windfarm owners, investment funds,
            buyers, sellers, regulators, windfarm developers, other consulting firms... basically all kinds of stakeholders of a wind energy project
            During this time I've been involved with
            <ul>
              <li><b>Layout optimization</b> (how to best position turbines as to generate more energy, reduce load, respect protected areas)</li>
              <li>Visiting operational wind farms</li>
              <li>Inspecting measurement masts <b>2500 km from home</b></li>
              <li>Energy assessments of <b>several</b> operational wind farms across the world</li>
              <li>Training <b>new engineers</b> just as I was trained during my internship</li>
              <li>Supporting engineers in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Spain, France, Turkey and England</li>
              <li>Wind farm noise assessments</li>
              <li>Wind farm shadow flicker assessments</li>

              <li>Challenging exchanges to uphold the <b>company's methodology</b> and <b>neutral stance</b> against unhappy stakeholders</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>At DNV we have the responsibility to deliver results that are in accordance with measured data and physical reality. <br/>
                    Sometimes that means telling hard truths like "wind energy generation for this site is predicted to be lower than anticipated". <br/>
                    That's where DNV's trust comes from.

          <h2>Minuano</h2>
          <p>
            On Azure Dev Ops
            Minuano: Renewables Utilities
            Minuano is the name given to a strong, constant, sharp and dry wind that comes all the way from the Pacific, through the Andes and eventually reaches the south of Brazil. It has been named after an indigenous tribe that used to inhabit these lands - the Minuanos. This name was chosen for this project to honor the ancient and still ongoing relationship of local inhabitants to the wind.

            The Problem
            Many analysts with some level of programming skills go off and produce useful scripts often sharing them with others. This is great but there are major drawbacks:

            Not all analysts (current and future) will have these scripts
            As each script evolves and changes, different colleagues end up with different versions of the script
            There's a lot of infrastructure code that needs to exist for someone to be able to share his creation in a useful and intuitive way
            The Solution
            To final users
            Minuano attempts to centralize such efforts into self-contained and easily accessible apps, with a useful user interface that doesn't require any programming knowledge of the final user.

            To developers
            Minuano aims to be a platform for creators. Anyone with some level of programming skill can contribute. Ever felt like some laborious task could be automated but thought it was too much work (other than the actual work, how will I distribute it to others, make it easy to install and use)?

            Minuano abstracts away all the infrastructure work so you can focus on your solution. Several other wind analysts with interest in learning/shaperning programming skills have joined the minuano initiative and learned something from the experience even if no end product resulted from the effort.

            For instance, our most recent addition came from someone who wasn't involved in the creation of minuano: Mirko Hoyo created an automated generator of GIS maps!

            The final product
            Minuano ends up as a web application (which runs on any browser) reachable by one-click at a desktop shortcut. It is composed of many "apps" which can be accessed at the click of a button.
