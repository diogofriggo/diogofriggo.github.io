            Performed wind energy analysis on several projects across Brazil<br/>
            DNV has so many great qualities as a company but what stands out is its people,

          <h2>Started degree in Computer Science</h2>
          <p>
            Ever more fascinated with programming I decided to step up my game and got into university.
            I struggled in some classes mostly because I couldn't in any way get interested in them<br/>
            On the other hand I loved and excelled at many STEM subjects like:
            <ul>
              <li>Probability theory</li>
              <li>Linear algebra</li>
              <li>Calculus (got invited to mentor other students)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            There were also a lot of other classes that were not exactly my cup of tea but were worth learning like
            Computer Architecture, Logic Circuits, Ethics and Philosophy
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of two years I reflected upon the choices I had made so far and the path that they have led me to <br/>
            Even though I had no regrets, after those STEM classes I felt that I needed to learn more about applied mathematics,
            physics in particular and so I left Computer <a class="vanilla" href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6e04179001a9ff6b3f1bb7fe5de9a3da/998a7d015d8ea65a-9a/s540x810/5a05ccb0f6b0f8c20307e4fb039b985066af3ded.pnj">Stience</a> for good<br/>
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since programming has been an integral part of my life ever since, I frequently ended up studying the field since then and to this day</p>

          <p>MS paint was the pinnacle of software at the time, enough to amaze a geek teenager. Every aspect of a PC was a mystery to me - games in particular.</p>
