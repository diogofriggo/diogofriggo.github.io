          <h2>First job!</h2>
          <p>
            Opportunities to work with software development for unexperienced developers (regardless of academic qualification) were <b>scarce</b> at the
            time - there wasn't such a shortage of talent as is common nowadays.<br/>
            So I got very excited when I learned that a multinational software and hardware company had recently opened a branch in Brazil. <br/>
            Still, they had a ton of developers already and didn't need one more - much less an inexperienced one. <br/>
            It was my <b>first interview in English</b> and having studied English extensively since I was a child I
            did very well, so when they turned me down for a developer role I told them:
          </p> <blockquote>Hey, you're still going to need
              someone to handle english-portuguese communication with local clients, I could do that</blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a long shot and not really what I wanted but in my head I planned on switching roles as soon as possible - I just <b>needed to get in</b> somehow.<br/>
            I pushed my luck and it worked! They said they did indeed need someone to translate documents and help with talking to local clients both in-person and via Skype.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I just needed to do a good job and convince them that an academic programmer could do commercial work,
            so I found the perfect opportunity to show my qualifications: <b>student to business...</b>

          <h2>Student to Business</h2>
          <p>In partnership with <b>Microsoft</b> and a local university, <b>Dell</b> launched a program to qualify aspiring software
            developers in different areas around the .NET ecosystem like</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Systems Development</li>
            <li>Network Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>More than three thousand applicants had to go through a test to qualify for the program.
            From those, 68 remained where we studied among other things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compilers</li>
            <li>Managed vs Unmanaged code</li>
            <li>VS 2018 GUI apps</li>
            <li>Programming Logic and Fundamentals on C#</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
            <li>ASP.NET</li>
            <li>Web Development Fundamentals</li>
            <li>UX</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>Web Services, SOAP</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All activities were <b>heavily exercise-oriented</b>. We partnered with a colleague and did several exercises a day<br/>
            The course was organized in stages, and we had to pass exams to advance to each next stage.
          </p>

          <h3>Student to Business Advanced</h3>

          <p>Through yet another exam, further 8 applicants were selected to join S2B Advanced<br/>
          Here we delved deeper into earlier topics as well as learning theoretical aspects of XML and communication protocols
          </p>

          <h2>Software developer at last!</h2>

          <p>
            Succeeding in S2B was my way of proving to my employer that I was able to develop commercial software and
            leave my role as translator.
            So adding it to my 3-year technician in programming plus a Microsoft Certified Tech Specialist in
            <b>.NET Framework Web Applications</b> and a host of shorter courses on a range of tech subjects I was ready
            to talk to the head of software development and ask for an opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            On that same day I met the branch director over lunch with the dev team's manager. I had a stack of certificates in my backpack.<br/>
            That was the perfect opportunity and I seized it. I told them of my ambition and hard work put into becoming a software
            developer and how much I'd like to be part of the dev team.<br/>
            The director looked at my manager and said:
          </p> <blockquote>Why is this guy not developing software yet?</blockquote>
          <p>
            That was a happy day!

          <h2>Software developer at HCL</h2>

          <p>
            I had many very competent, motivated and experienced colleagues to learn from.
            What I learned from them was worth every single ounce of hard work to get there. But the person who enabled
            me to grow the most was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alklaser/">Alexandre Klaser</a>. He had a huge
            impact not only on my career but also on my personal life. I admire him to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some would question whether an inexperienced dev was a right fit for the project, Alexandre would
            trust me with more and more responsibilities, to the point that after 1 year the once inexperienced dev
            would then be in charge in defining and maintaining the architecture of new projects and addressing doubts
            from more experienced developers
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many companies at the time we were trying to push for Agile adoption.
            And like many companies we failed in some respects but succeeded in many others.
            One of the most gratifying feedback from a client went like this:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            We've been trying to build this inventory management system for years and everytime on the delivery day
            we'd find out that what we got is not what we wanted. Your are the first company to deliver what we asked for
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            That was not by accident. We delivered biweekly. By the final delivery stakeholders would have had plenty of
            opportunities to say that we were not building what they wanted. That's why we succeeded!
          </p>

          <p>
            We tried to follow Agile by the book (or should I say by the manifesto) but reality, company- and
            client-specific issues presented many unforeseen challenges. I had a wonderful team that acted in good-faith
            and with the client's interest in mind and heart and managed to overcome every obstacle.
            I think it's fair to say that Agile provided the framework and the people, the engine.
          </p>

          <h3>Full-stack developer</h3>
          <p>
              I'd build applications from the ground up with an Agile team. From the HTML, vanilla CSS
              (no SASS, Stylus and the like back then) and JavaScript in the front-end to C#, ASP .NET MVC and
              MS SQL with NHibernate on the back-end<br/>
              On the front-end we experimented with many different libraries and did some projects with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> but it was
              too bare bones and we ended up settling for the more feature-complete <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a><br/>
              Other mature libraries that we have today like React were not in existence back then.<br/>
              On the server side we had great separation of concerns and the architecture served us well on all projects
          </p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Among many commercial projects we developed I'd highlight the following three which we've built from scratch:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>A pharmaceutical management system for a brazilian healthcare company, this project also featured as
                spin-off a web app that would track drug delivery just as is common nowadays when you order food</li>
              <li>An insurance management system for an american firm based in Chicago</li>
              <li>A personnel and operations management system for a large roads operator in Latin America</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Computer Science: the good stuff</h2>
          <p>
            Ever more fascinated with programming I decided to step up my game and got into university.<br/>
            This was my first experience in college. I learned a lot of valuable things that'd later shape career and academic decisions<br/>
            I loved and excelled at many STEM subjects like:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Probability theory</li>
              <li>Linear algebra</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Formal propositional Logic (just apply a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">Modus Ponens</a>!)</li>
            </ul>
          <p>My great interest in calculus led the professor to invite me to mentor students the following semester.</p>
          <p>When I decided to join college I had a really weak background in math and I knew that CS would be math heavy<br/>
          Khan Academy was unknown at the time but there was great content to be found if you knew where to look.
          I found Jason with his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathtutordvd.com/">MathTutorDVD</a> amazing series, I took one
          entire vacation from work + a few more months leading to college and studied them all:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core Math</li>
            <li>Algebra 1</li>
            <li>Algebra 2</li>
            <li>Trig &amp; Pre-Calculus</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These provided me with a strong foundation for college and beyond</p>

          <p>While in college I wrote this simple <a target="_blank" href="http://assemblyparser.apphb.com/">live-edit assembly parser</a> which, to my surprise, is still live

          <h2>Computer Science dropout</h2>
          <p>
            I struggled in some classes mostly because I couldn't in any way get interested in them. A geek like me
            finds entertainment in the most arcane wikipedia article so that was a hint that something was not right
          </p>
          <p>
            There were also a lot of other classes that were not exactly my cup of tea but were worth learning like
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Computer Architecture focused on hardware</li>
              <li>Algorithm Complexity Analysis</li>
              <li>Logic Circuits</li>
              <li>Ethics and Anthropology</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            And some others I downright disagreed with the approach to it like <b>Requirements Engineering</b> where
            they preached old proven-to-be-wrong-from-decades-of-failure methods. <br/>
            I was practicing <a target="_blank" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> in a multinational
            software dev company at the time and this class would argue for the opposite. Listening to it was like hearing the sound of fingernails scraping a chalkboard!<br/>
            It's important to understand what these approaches were and why they failed but never to encourage using them when a better alternative is widely known!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of two years I reflected upon the choices I had made so far and the path that they have led me to. <br/>
            Even though I had barely any regrets, after those STEM classes I felt that I needed to learn more about applied mathematics -
            physics in particular - and so I left CS for good<br/>
          </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, since programming continued to be an integral part of my life, I frequently ended up
            studying the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">field</a> since then

          <p>
            After getting to know PUC university from my time in the S2B program, I started to watch some of their
            open lectures on software. <br/> One of them in particular caught my attention. It was a lecture on how <b>NodeJS</b> could be
            used to reverse the HTTP model, that is, actively sending a response to clients without them having
            initiated a request in the first place!<br/>
            Nowadays this is known as the <b>WebSocket protocol</b>, but it was exciting news back then.<br/>
            Inspired by the lecture I built a collaborative keyboard later on that day.<br/>

            time in a row and would keep the crown for 6 more years!
            That's where I wanted to study some sort of applied mathematics. <br/>
            While researching which course was the best fit to what I wanted to learn I found <b>Physics Engineering</b> - a perfect match!<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Admission to my previous university was very easy. Being admitted in one of the best universities of the country was an entirely different challenge.<br/>
            Even though I had improved a lot on my math skills I knew I still had a <b>very poor background</b> on every other
            subject like History, Chemistry, Biology, Literature... well, basically everything else.
            That was so because the level of teaching in public schools where I grew up is light-years behind what's required to join higher-level studies.<br/>
            So even though I have always been a good student and had excellent grades I knew that coming from a public school I had a lot of catching up to do.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to focus all my attention on it so I <b>quit my job</b>, took the money I had and payed for a full-year
            preparation course to UFRGS's fiercely competitive admission exams (much like SATs) which cover in-depth every subject learned in school.<br/>
            I used my remaining savings to support myself during the whole year, frequently having to make some hard
            choices on priorities like having enough money for commute and food or buying required books.

          <h2>Physics Engineering!</h2>
          <p>
            After a full year of preparation culminating in four long days of admission exams I fulfilled the <b>dream</b> of getting into this university!<br/>
            Physics engineering was a very new course. When I joined, there weren't any graduates yet.
            However, the curriculum and the idea behind the course was enough to dispel any doubts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was simple: just as a mechanical engineer applies well-know physics established some 4 centuries
            ago and an electrical engineer applies physics known for over 2 centuries, a physics engineer would be in a
            position to apply <b>20th-century-onwards physics</b> into solving real-life issues, particularly ones involving cutting-edge technology.
            Keep in mind the nearly exponential growth of science output before thinking the physics engineer has less to learn!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since science is built upon earlier work rather than replacing it, for the first two years we learned the
            foundations common to all engineering courses such as:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Foundational Physics</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>
              <li>Technical drawing</li>
              <li>Fundamental Chemistry</li>
              <li>Linear Algebra</li>
              <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
              <li>Classical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Electromagnetic Theory</li>
              <li>Applied Mathematics (think Fourier transforms and Vector analysis)</li>
              <li>Differential Equations Theory</li>
              <li>Thermodynamics</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The physics engineer also learns about a bunch of other subjects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mathematical Methods (think calculus in the complex plane, green's functions) </li>
              <li>Nanotechnology</li>
              <li>Photonics</li>
              <li>Biophysics</li>
              <li>Computational Methods</li>
              <li><b>Quantum Mechanics</b> (perhaps the toughest subject - we joke that this is the course's turning point)</li>
              <li>Analog and digital electronics</li>
              <li>Instrumentation</li>
              <li>Interaction of Radiation and Matter</li>
              <li>Econophysics</li>
              <li>Spectroscopy</li>
              <li>Semiconductors</li>
              <li>Microprocessors</li>
              <li>Statistical Mechanics</li>
              <li>Solid State Theory</li>
              <li>Renewable Energy</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            I can't list everything out here or you'll be bored to death. Let me just say that it's 5 intense years of
            studying where we learn a bit of everything so that as graduates we may choose to specialize in one or more particular areas of engineering.<br/>
            It was one of the best decisions I've made in life - what I learned at UFRGS is priceless, it opened up whole new worlds to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally to the regular subjects, UFRGS also allows one to attend classes from different departments.
            So I took a <b>introductory</b> class on Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Electrodynamics for theoretical physicists and a class from the mathematics
            department: <b>Analysis</b> - by far the hardest subject I've ever taken but immensely beautiful at the same time<br/>
            The following cards will feature a few highlights of my time at uni

          <h2>Symmetry groups</h2>
          <p>
            When taking Organic Chemistry I automated the <b>tedious</b> task of extracting an irreducible representation from a reducible one<br/>
            I started it in <b>Ruby</b> and later switched to Python due to better library support.
            The code takes user input, downloads all character tables from <a href="http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de">http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de</a>
            and returns the corresponding irreducible representation.<br/>
            I shared this with classmates saving us a lot of time!<br/>
            The resulting CLI could be used like this

          <h2>Batman potential</h2>
          <p>
            Exact solutions to quantum problems are far and between and only exist for highly idealized or simple
            systems like a square potential. But computational physics knows no bounds!
            I wanted to show to my classmates that we could take the ideas we learned and apply it to any system.
            They were skeptical so instead of simulating a square potential like this:

            <img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/square.png" alt="Square Potential"/>

            I simulated a batman potential:

            <img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/batman.gif" alt="Batman Potential"/>

            That's a probability wave interacting with a potential type Batman as I have dubbed it.<br/>
            At each step Schrödinger's equation is being solved for each value of the domain<br/>
          </p>
            <blockquote>Fun fact: note how some probability is sneaking through to the other side of the square potential.</blockquote>
          <p>
            Classical mechanics says this is impossible. It's the macroscopic equivalent of a throwing a <b>ball at a wall</b>
            and expecting that it'll eventually <b>go through</b> unscathed if you try enough times. Not impossible in the quantum world!
          </p>
          <p>
            The animation in the bottom depicts the same process in momentum space.<br/>
            For the math geeks out there: that is a function! It doesn't appear so but it is piecewise defined so it
            is injective (how else could I draw a batman shape with a function?)<br/>
            This also means that it's highly discontinuous, go solve that on pen and paper!<br/>

          <h2>Fast Fourier Transform: Functional Programming</h2>

          <p>The FFT by itself can be used on pictures to reveal some really interesting physics. <br/>
            Take a look at the cover where on the right you have the Fourier-transformed version of the
            left picture, produced by just applying an inverse fourier transform to each pixel on the left<br/>
            The left picture is a microscopy image of <b>graphene</b> while on the right you see it in momentum space revealing several symmetries
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution of the Schrödinger's equation for the Batman potential in the card above requires computing Fourier transforms<br/>
            I ended up doing it in Python but I wanted to try it on a functional language so I picked up some <b>Haskell</b>
            and the resulting code is quite neat (5 lines) since the problem lends itself well to a functional style:

          {% highlight haskell %}

          f xs n = exp $ -(0:+2*pi)*n / genericLength xs

          --only 2 two arguments
          ffti [x,y] n = x + y * (exp $ -(0:+pi)*n)

          fft xs [] = []
          fft xs (y:ys) = (ffti xs y):(fft xs ys)

          <h2>A boring day at university!</h2>

          <p>
            One day at uni when I had some classes in the morning and the next classes only late in the afternoon I
            felt bored as there was no homework to be done nor any other task that needed my attention.
            I remembered that my cousin was addicted to games and would play nonstop. I wished he'd do something more challenging to his intellect.<br/>
            So to help him I opened up a book-tutorial on <b>Unity</b> and built a game with it so I could show to him how the thing he likes is
            done so that perhaps a taste of game development and programming would lure him into the hard sciences (as in all the math behind a game).<br/>
            It was surprisingly little effort for such a great result.
            I basically managed to build a <b>3d third person game</b> where the character can roam across an island
            discovering the bright-colored landscape full of trees and hills under a shining sun<br/>
            I tweaked gravity and friction so he'd be able to perform some stunts and climb the steepest hills.
            Pardon the landscaping - not my strong suit!<br/>
            Unfortunately he did not find it nearly as interesting as I had hoped. <br/>
            I think he was too young for it back then. Perhaps I'll try him again!

            Approximately <b>1000</b> lines of assembly on a PIC18F2580 <b>microprocessor</b>.<br/>
            This was a challenging project. I remember having trouble sleeping because I'd spend hours <b>awake debugging the code</b> on my head. <br/>
            Doing anything in assembly is hard enough so imagine doing the following:

          <h3>Undergraduate thesis</h3>

          <p>
            This internship was required as part of my Physics Engineering degree. <br/>
            Since I was deeply interested in the work I was doing I wrote my undergraduate thesis on a <b>stochastic</b> model aimed
            at predicting wind speed behavior (and thus energy production) at short time-scales<br/>
            It was entirely developed in <b>R</b> relying on its excellent statistical libraries.<br/>
            Below you can get an idea of the main result: good prediction 4 months into the future without ad-hoc assumptions about the model<br/>
            Y-axis represents wind speed and X-axis days.

          <h2>Engineer at DNV</h2>
          <p>
            DNV is a large assurance, classification and certification company that has been building its business based on trust for over 1.5 centuries<br/>
            With more than 12000 employees spread across the globe, it is present in many markets. <br/>
            I work in one of its largest divisions: <b>Energy Systems</b>, where I carry out Wind Energy Assessments and develop <b>R&amp;D</b> projects. <br/>
            Nowadays I'm part of a highly motivated team of <b>~50 engineers</b> spread across Central and South America, Iberia, Africa and the Middle East.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an engineer I've worked so far on 60 projects for external clients: wind farm owners, investment funds,
            buyers, sellers, regulators, wind farm developers, other consulting firms... basically all kinds of stakeholders of a wind energy project<br/>
            During this time I've done a lot:

          </p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Layout optimization</b> (how to best position turbines as to generate more energy, reduce load, respect protected areas)</li>
              <li>Assisted clients in defining the layout of their wind farms</li>
              <li>Visited operational wind farms</li>
              <li>Inspected measurement masts <b>2500 km from home</b> (that's me in the picture above)</li>
              <li>Trained <b>new engineers</b> just as I was trained during my internship</li>
              <li>Supported engineers in Chile, Brazil, Mexico, England, Spain, France, Germany, Turkey, India and Australia</li>
              <li>
                Several energy assessments for proposed wind farms
                <ul>
                  <li>These analysis are mainly based on raw speed and direction data measured at a few masts, lidars or sodars for a given turbine layout</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Energy assessments of <b>several</b> operational wind farms across the world.
                <ul>
                  <li>These involved learning a whole different set of skills. Unlike pre-constructive assessments one

          <h2>Report automation</h2>
          <br/>
          <h3>The problem</h3>
          <p>
            Many engineers regularly having to write a 300-page report manually copying and pasting information from
            several sources into a word template document. <br/>
            Other than the time spent, this approach frequently led to mistakes which delayed review and consequently
            delivery - the whole process could take up to 4 days
          </p>

          <h3>The solution</h3>
          <p>
            Developed an easy to use web app in <b>Dash</b>: now with a few clicks an energy analyst indicates
            where the many inputs are located, presses a button and within minutes gets a report with roughly 75% of
            all data filled in.<br/>
            The remaining 25% were either very difficult to automate and thus didn't justify the effort to develop a
            solution to it or could not be done without human judgement.<br/>
            A report can now be written in <b>less than a day</b> with far fewer mistakes.
          </p>

          <h3>The details</h3>
          <p>
            The core technology comes from the <b>libxml2 C library</b> which was ported to Python as <a href="https://lxml.de/">lxml</a>.<br/>
            With it I can easily manipulate word's underlying OOXML, that is, I can change it programmatically to inject external information. <br/>
            Knowing where to put the information is done via markers placed throughout the report template.<br/>
            An earlier step of the code converts these markers into Word's Structured Document Tags
            <img itemprop="image" src="/assets/img/sdt.jpg" alt="Structured Document Tag"/>
            They are basically xml with an identifier attached to it. <br/>
            The neat thing about these tags is that I can replace the body text and they don't go away,
            this allows us to later update the report when needed, say with a different turbine layout
            Information to fill the report comes from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Results from several internal excel tools</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.dnv.com/services/wind-resource-assessment-software-windfarmer-analyst-3766">WindFarmer</a></li>
            <li>Other word reports</li>
            <li>The web</li>
            <li>.csv and other textual formats</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Inputs change their format or underlying representation quite frequently so this input-gathering aspect of
            the solution is a burden to maintain. Another team is currently addressing this with a single-source
            approach by further standardizing the workflow

          <h2>Communication skills challenge</h2>
          <p>
            We perform very technical work which is usually very difficult to convey to clients, and we spend a whole lot of our time explaining the same thing to different clients<br/>
            So our manager challenged us to make a short video explaining any <b>difficult concept</b> not necessarily related to wind energy<br/>
            The core idea was to find a better format for sharing technical information with non-technical clients.<br/>
            A short video with a clear narrative was to be pursued.
          </p>
          <h3>3Blue1Brown</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a big fan of Grant Sanderson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k">3b1b</a> youtube
            channel where he explains math and physics very eloquently and with beautiful animations - it seemed like a perfect format.<br/>
            I then found out that he open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">manim</a> (Math Animation), the library he uses to make those videos!
            So from there I learned how to do it myself.<br/>
            I decided to explain a very familiar concept: <b>Pythagoras Theorem</b>, sure you know the formula by heart
            but can you prove it from first principles or give a geometrical proof? <br/>
            Here's the short version where I show you how Pythagoras did it
            <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGs9ZBdUOf8"></iframe>
          </p>
          <p>
            For my colleagues I used <b>Blender</b> to compile a longer version motivating the problem and contrasting the explanatory power
            of using <b>only words</b> versus <b>words + images</b> versus <b>words + animations</b>. My point was that animations are worth a 1000 images (sometimes literally :))!

          <h2>Minuano</h2>
          <br/>
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Many analysts with some level of programming skills produce useful tools often sharing them with others. <br/>
              This is great but there are major drawbacks:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Not all analysts (current and future) will have easy access to these tools because they are scattered
                throughout the company
              </li>
              <li>As each tool evolves and changes, different people end up with different versions of it</li>
              <li>Every new tool needs to reinvent the wheel for the common bits like user interface, version management,
                integration with other tools, continuous integration, distribution... the list is long
              </li>
              <li>In the long run it's very hard to maintain several tools living in completely separate environments</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Solution: Minuano</h3>

            <p>
              A centralized, self-contained and easily accessible dashboard of independent apps, abstracting away
              everything that is common to every app.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Every analyst has the latest version company-wide</li>
              <li>Tool makers can focus only on their code and rely on Minuano to handle everything else</li>
              <li>Straightforward to integrate a new tool into Minuano</li>
              <li>Hosted on Azure DevOps, accessible company wide</li>
              <li>Very intuitive to analysts (non-programmers) who previously had to manually run scripts and make sense of stack traces</li>
              <li>Accessible from a desktop shortcut on each user's machine</li>
              <li>Much easier to maintain</li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>
              Minuano is the name given to a strong, constant, sharp and dry wind that comes all the way from the
              Pacific, through the Andes and eventually reaches the south of Brazil. It has been named after an
              indigenous tribe that used to inhabit these lands - the Minuanos. The name was chosen to honor the
              ancient relationship of local inhabitants to wind which for today's inhabitants has taken the
              form of capturing energy from it with wind turbines!

          <h2>CFD post-processor</h2>
          <br/>
          <h3>The problem</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Several DNV offices across the globe perform CFD simulations on the same supercomputer</li>
            <li>Each simulation can occupy hundreds of gigabytes, sometimes terabytes of disk space</li>
            <li>Most of this information is redundant</li>
            <li>Old projects must be archived on external hard drives only to be retrieved later when needed</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This was a major problem during the pandemic because it meant someone had to go the office in-person to retrieve information</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h3>The solution</h3>
          <p>
            The solution came from an insight from my great colleague
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leobarriatto">Leonardo Barriatto</a>.<br/>
            He realized that we could keep only a few isoheight slices of each simulation. When an intermediate isoheight was
            needed we could get it from simple linear interpolation without any significant loss of precision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was in charge of implementing the solution. I leveraged the whole <b>Minuano</b> infrastructure and built
            the solution as a new app to it. Integration was a breeze and the whole archiving system was made <b>obsolete</b>
          </p>

          <h3>Later stages of the tool</h3>
          <p>The tool has since grown to bring more and more features under its umbrella:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Generating point wind resource files at turbine locations taking stability-weighting into account</li>
            <li>Analyzing speed-up plots</li>
            <li>Computing cross-prediction errors</li>
            <li>A very rich reactive UI enabling outstanding UX</li>
            <li>Thorough user input validation that warns and prevents invalid use cases before running any calculation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Leonardo's skill as a <b>project manager</b> was fundamental to this project as it enabled a smooth workflow that allowed
            me to focus on technical aspects of the work while he worried about everything else. <br/>
            The tool had significant success, it is used frequently by about a dozen CFD analysts company-wide.

          <h2>Part-time WindFarmer developer</h2>
          <p>
            Since September 2021 I've been dedicating roughly half of my working time to developing features into
            <a href="https://www.dnv.com/services/wind-resource-assessment-software-windfarmer-analyst-3766">WindFarmer</a> <br/>
            WindFarmer is used by Wind Engineers both inside and outside of DNV, with decades of presence in the industry.
            At DNV it is the backbone of wind energy assessments, being used for nearly everything from data import to energy results. <br/>
            Being an experienced Wind Engineer and Software Developer put me in a unique position to contribute to the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team works under the <b>Agile</b> framework, releasing software roughly once a month and with two-week <b>sprints</b>.
            Most of the team is based in Bristol, the 3 to 4-hour timezone difference presented some challenges<br/>
            Among other things, during this time I have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Done many code reviews</li>
            <li>Demoed new features to stakeholders</li>
            <li>Fixed several bugs, including ones arising from legacy layers of the codebase</li>
            <li>Contributed to a wind farm validation paper presented at <a href="https://windeurope.org/">WindEurope</a> in 2022</li>
            <li>Gathered feedback from internal users around the company and implemented solutions to their needs</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In particular, addressed pain points and missing features that users were keenly waiting on</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Retired external scripts by bringing the same functionality into the software</li>
            <li>Wrote a Python client to a user-facing WindFarmer API at a client's request</li>
            <li>Retired a few steps of the workflow of legacy excel tools (still pending a full replacement)</li>
            <li>Implemented a <a href="https://github.com/OrstedRD/TurbOPark">new wake model</a> developed and open-sourced by a third party</li>

            Titled <b>Validating the next generation of turbine interaction models</b>, this effort required some intense automation and data wrangling.<br/>
            Even though my contribution was solely on that area, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhlevick/">Tom Levick</a>
            was kind enough in including my name on the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2257/1/012010">paper</a>.<br/>
            Tom carried out all the downstream tasks of making sense of the data and extracting meaningful results from it<br/>
            It was a pleasure to work with him, his motivation is contagious.<br/>

            <li>The tool took regularly more than a day to finish running (on a supercomputer)</li>
            <li>For larger areas and many masts this tool would take more than a week to run</li>
            <li>The legacy codebase was hard to change and/or extend with new features</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The solution</h3>
          <p>
            With funding from the CFD department, the legacy tool was rewritten from scratch in less than a month<br/>

          <ul>
            <li>Powered by <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> the new tool now produces the same results

            <ul>
              <li>One sample case took 74010 seconds (supercomputer) in the legacy tool and 196 seconds (laptop) in the new one, that's a <b>~400x speed up</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>New tool extended with additional features</li>
            <li>3000+ lines of Rust code integrated easily into <b>Minuano</b> via <b>PyO3</b> leveraging all the
              benefits of Minuano, in particular a façade for thorough validation of input data which then gets sent to Rust</li>
            <li>Rust efficient use of memory was taken to the extreme to enable ingestion of gigabytes of CFD simulation grids,
              processing and writing results back to disk altogether in the seconds to few minutes range depending on project-size</li>
