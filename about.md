Hi I'm Diogo! I live in the south of Brazil and created this blog to share useful insights into things that I work on

In particular you'll see lots of posts about the rust language as I apply it to solve problems in the wind energy industry.

On occasion you might see posts about other languages like Elixir or Haskell and also posts about CFD and animation, stay tuned!

### Why another Rust blog

Despite the great community effort to ease the steep Rust learning curve, I still think there's a huge gap between
beginner-level content and the very high-end pro content. It's hard to find something in between.

This blog tries to help fill that gap.
